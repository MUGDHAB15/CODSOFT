Data Science Internship projects - BATCH A8 WITH CODSOFT

It is a virtual interniship program for 1 month, where in we were given 5 TASKS to complete. A minimum of three tasks are mandatory to complete to be eligible for the certificate and completing the interniship.
I am really thankful to CODSOFT for this opportunity, and learning which will surely help me in future reaching my goal.

### Following are the three tasks which I had done:

1. ### TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION -
     Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
     This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
     The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

2.### MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON: 
                   Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression 
                   techniques to tackle this problem. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
                   critics. Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that
                   influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

  3. ### CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:
     Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
     imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
     forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
     and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

### How to use the files:
1. I have incorporated my python files with the project name respectively so one can use them to see the actual code
2. I have used Jupyter notebook to do my project
3. I have saved the data sets as well for the projects, only for the credit card i have mentioned it as a link above because the file was quite big to upload here.

### OVERALL EXPERIENCE:
I am very delightful with the experience I got working on these projects. It really helped me gain variety of knowledge. I learned to use various models and modules from python for the first time. 
Now I am much more confident. It is a very nice platform to gain experience and the team is quiet helpful if have any doubts.

In case you have any querry please feel free to provide any feeback or for any querry message me.

Thanx and happy coding ðŸ“ŠðŸ™Œ
